        "One hundred years ago, at the end of December 1922, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was born. A little more than five years after the end of the Russian Revolution that brought the Tsarist Empire to an end, a multi-ethnic nation-state that promised a socialist future and the protection of national identity was established out of the chaos of civil war. <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Vladimir Lenin</span>, the creator and first leader of the Soviet Union, had denounced Tsarist Russia for holding Russians and non-Russians in a “prison of nations.” His new Soviet Union would unite the exploited masses of the old Tsarist lands in a country that was “national in form, socialist in content.” The economic and political systems were to follow a <span class=\"highlight-politics\">socialist</span> line of development in the pursuit of leading the people to <span class=\"highlight-politics\">communism</span>, but the culture and traditions of the individual Soviet republics would be allowed to continue. The Russification of the Tsarist era was over, as was the Russian <span class=\"highlight-politics\">chauvinism</span> that <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Lenin</span> despised.<br>",
        "However, as was so often the case in Soviet history, the reality of this new way of life didn’t live up to the promises made by the Party bosses in <span class=\"highlight-location\">Moscow</span>. What emerged was a huge nation that forced millions of people into a federation initially made up of <span class=\"highlight-location\">Russia</span>, <span class=\"highlight-location\">Ukraine</span>, <span class=\"highlight-location\">Byelorussia</span>, and the Transcaucasian republics of <span class=\"highlight-location\">Armenia</span>, <span class=\"highlight-location\">Azerbaijan</span>, and <span class=\"highlight-location\">Georgia</span>. Over the next two decades, the USSR became the world’s largest country (building on what was already the world’s largest country, <span class=\"highlight-location\">Russia</span>) as new republics were added from the lands that surrounded <span class=\"highlight-location\">Russia</span> and that had made up the old Tsarist empire. These included <span class=\"highlight-location\">the Baltic States</span>, which were incorporated against their will as part of the Nazi-Soviet pact signed in August 1939. By the end of the 1940s, the Soviet Union was one of two nuclear superpowers, and it remained in a cold war with the other superpower—<span class=\"highlight-location\">the United States</span>—until <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Mikhail Gorbachev</span> oversaw the breakup and collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991.<br>",
        "The huge new nation created by <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Lenin</span> in 1922 was far from what he believed would emerge from the revolutionary upheaval of 1917. His <span class=\"highlight-politics\">Marxism</span> was outward-looking and <span class=\"highlight-politics\">internationalist</span>, and he rejected <span class=\"highlight-politics\">patriotism</span> and <span class=\"highlight-politics\">nationalism</span>. And although, as <span class=\"highlight-person\">David R. Marples</span> notes, the USSR initially “saw a flowering of national cultures in republics like <span class=\"highlight-location\">Ukraine</span> and <span class=\"highlight-location\">Belarus</span>, and especially the growing importance of national languages,” <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Joseph Stalin</span> moved away from this policy in the 1930s by centralizing authority and concentrating more power in the hands of the Party leaders in <span class=\"highlight-location\">Moscow</span>. The story of the creation of the Soviet Union was therefore one that began with the overthrowing of the Tsar and the promise to free Russia’s exploited masses and ended with the birth of a powerful, bureaucratic, and undemocratic state that killed off the hopes of the Russian Revolutions.<br>",
        "<h2>The Revolution and Civil War: The Prison Gates Pushed Ajar</h2> The creation of a state like the Soviet Union wasn’t the inevitable outcome of either of the revolutions of 1917. Both the February Revolution and the October Revolution could have followed different paths and different leaders to define post-Tsarist nations. Part of the debate—and part of what prolonged the civil war that followed the <span class=\"highlight-politics\">Bolshevik</span>-led October Revolution—was based on the concept of national self-determination. People across the Russian Empire freed themselves from the shackles of Tsarism in 1917. Russian control was swept away and once-oppressed nations were granted autonomy. They then set about establishing new states, free from Russian governance.<br>",
        "<span class=\"highlight-location\">Ukraine</span> was just one of many states that rapidly took steps toward confirming its independence. The formation of Ukraine’s parliament, <span class=\"highlight-politics\">the Central Rada</span>, confirmed <span class=\"highlight-location\">Kyiv</span>’s move away from Petrograd’s control even as the February Revolution unfolded. Cultural freedom was promoted, the Ukrainian language became more prevalent in schools and the press, and in April 1917, <span class=\"highlight-politics\">the Rada</span> was declared as the supreme national institution. <span class=\"highlight-politics\">The Provisional Government</span> in <span class=\"highlight-location\">Petrograd</span>, however, continued to be less than enthusiastic about granting <span class=\"highlight-location\">Ukraine</span> its autonomy.<br>",
        "Today, President <span class=\"highlight-person\">Vladimir Putin</span> blames <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Lenin</span> for creating the modern-day <span class=\"highlight-location\">Ukrainian state</span>. (For <span class=\"highlight-person\">Putin</span>, the USSR’s collapse was “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century” and, according to <span class=\"highlight-person\">Natalia Chaban</span>, <span class=\"highlight-person\">Henrietta Mondry</span>, and <span class=\"highlight-person\">Evgeny Pavlov</span>, if he “had a chance to alter modern Russian history, he would reverse the collapse of the Soviet Union.”) But blaming—or crediting—Lenin with Ukrainian independence is misguided. As <span class=\"highlight-person\">Serhii Plokhii</span> has noted, “<span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Lenin</span> was indeed central to the formation of the USSR.” But as far as an independent <span class=\"highlight-location\">Ukraine</span>, it came into existence “not thanks to <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Lenin</span> but against his wishes.” <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Lenin</span> concluded that independence plus compromise over culture and language were essential to maintaining <span class=\"highlight-politics\">communist</span> control of <span class=\"highlight-location\">Ukraine</span>.<br>",
        "The <span class=\"highlight-politics\">Bolsheviks</span> were wary of Ukraine’s push for autonomy, and after the October Revolution, when the Rada proclaimed independence, <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Lenin’s</span> party in <span class=\"highlight-location\">Kharkiv</span> declared a Soviet Republic instead. Confusion and conflict continued, but in January 1918, indigenous superiority was confirmed when <span class=\"highlight-politics\">the Rada</span> established the Ukrainian People’s Republic. Armed conflict between <span class=\"highlight-politics\">Bolshevik</span> and <span class=\"highlight-politics\">non-Bolshevik</span> forces continued until <span class=\"highlight-location\">Ukraine</span> became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union in 1922.<br>",
        "In the post-revolutionary <span class=\"highlight-location\">Caucasus</span>, <span class=\"highlight-politics\">the Russian Provisional Government</span> maintained a strong presence by forming <span class=\"highlight-politics\">the Special Transcaucasian Committee</span>. This brought together representatives of <span class=\"highlight-location\">Armenia</span>, <span class=\"highlight-location\">Azerbaijan</span>, and <span class=\"highlight-location\">Georgia</span>, while Russian dominance was asserted by <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Vasily Kharlamov</span>, a Kadet deputy from Russia’s <span class=\"highlight-politics\">Fourth Duma>/span>.",
        "The Committee lasted until the <span class=\"highlight-politics\">Bolsheviks</span> came to power, at which point a new body—<span class=\"highlight-politics\">the Transcaucasian Commissariat</span>—replaced it. Based in <span class=\"highlight-location\">Tiflis</span> (modern day <span class=\"highlight-location\">Tbilisi</span>, <span class=\"highlight-location\">Georgia</span>), <span class=\"highlight-location\">Armenia</span>, <span class=\"highlight-location\">Azerbaijan</span>, and <span class=\"highlight-location\">Georgia</span> had three representatives each in <span class=\"highlight-politics\">the Commissariat</span>, while <span class=\"highlight-location\">Russia</span> had two. The main leaders were <span class=\"highlight-politics\">Mensheviks</span> (who were well represented by Georgians), <span class=\"highlight-politics\">Socialist Revolutionaries</span>, <span class=\"highlight-politics\">Dashnaks</span> (Armenian nationalists), and Musavatists (Azeri Pan-Turkists). <span class=\"highlight-politics\">The Commissariat’s</span> <span class=\"highlight-politics\">anti-Bolshevik</span> position saw it reject the new Soviet government’s authority, and it sought to withdraw Transcaucasia from Soviet Russia. In February 1918, against the backdrop of both the Russian civil war and the Russian-Central Powers peace talks (the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk would end Russian participation in the Great War), <span class=\"highlight-politics\">the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic</span> was proclaimed, to be formally established two months later. <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Nikolay Chkheidze</span>, the Georgian <span class=\"highlight-politics\">Menshevik</span> leader of the Petrograd Soviet after the February Revolution, became its first leader.<br>",
        "The desire to free these nations from Russian rule was clear, and <span class=\"highlight-location\">Georgia</span> impressed international observers with the formation of the <span class=\"highlight-person\">Menshevik</span>-led Democratic Republic of Georgia, with <span class=\"highlight-location\">Tiflis</span> as its capital. As future British Prime Minister <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Ramsay MacDonald</span> wrote when he visited the country in 1920, the Georgians were democrats who had their revolution “without shooting an opponent, except when they were invaded [and] without suppressing a journal.” They had “elected a <span class=\"highlight-politics\">Constituent Assembly</span>, formed a temporary coalition [and] held a regular general election on adult suffrage, with full protection for all minorities.” This didn’t last though, as Georgian independence was ended by force when the (<span class=\"highlight-politics\">pro-Bolshevik</span>) Red Army entered <span class=\"highlight-location\">Tiflis</span> in February 1921. With this came the move to form the wider <span class=\"highlight-politics\">Transcaucasian Federation</span> in March 1922, tying the formerly independent <span class=\"highlight-location\">Armenia</span>, <span class=\"highlight-location\">Azerbaijan</span>, and <span class=\"highlight-location\">Georgia</span> together.<br>",
        "<h2>The Making of the Soviet Union</h2><br>",
        "Prior to the revolutionary events in 1917, the right to national self-determination was promised by leading <span class=\"highlight-politics\">Bolsheviks</span>, including <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Lenin</span> and <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Stalin</span>, who would become <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Lenin</span>’s Commissar for Nationalities. The party had long railed against <span class=\"highlight-politics\">imperialism</span> and continued to debate its position on <span class=\"highlight-politics\">nationalism</span>. <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Stalin</span>’s <span class=\"highlight-politics\">Marxism</span> and the National Question of 1913, argued that “A nation has the right freely to determine its own destiny. It has the right to arrange its life as it sees fit, without, of course, trampling on the rights of other nations. That is beyond dispute.” And <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Lenin</span>’s Imperialism: The Highest Stage of <span class=\"highlight-politics\">Capitalism</span>, written in 1916 and published in 1917, denounced the First World War for being “i<span class=\"highlight-politics\">mperialist</span> (that is, an annexationist, predatory war of plunder) on the part of both sides; it was a war for the division of the world, for the partition and repartition of colonies.”<br>",
        "Both interpretations made clear the <span class=\"highlight-politics\">communist opposition</span> to imposing and exerting control from outside a nation’s borders, but the Declaration of Union and Treaty of Union that brought the Soviet Union into being would facilitate just this. Moscow’s rule in the 1920s was not yet as complete as it would be in the following decade, when <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Stalin</span> centralized control, but the debates over the nature of the new state made leaders in the Soviet Republics uneasy, and they proved to be a forerunner of <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Stalin</span>’s plans for the future.<br>",
        "<span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Lenin</span> clashed with his Commissar for Nationalities over <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Stalin</span>’s push for the integration of non-Russian republics into the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic as autonomous republics. The leaders of these republics feared too much Russian power, and they were concerned that they could lose their right to secede from this union. They were right to be worried, as in theory this was protected but in practice there was no right to secession. <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Lenin</span> sided with them against <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Stalin</span>, and he agreed with their concern about Russian domination. However, real power continued to remain in <span class=\"highlight-location\">Moscow</span>, despite the supposedly devolved nature of Soviet power. Some areas, such as language, culture, and schooling, did prosper, but they did so only until the following decade when <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Stalin</span> centralized power even further.<br>",
        "<h2>The End of the Russian Revolution</h2><br>",
        "The Russian Revolution that promised—and for a time delivered—freedom to the peoples of the now former Tsarist Empire ended with the creation of the USSR. The aims of the February Revolution were never as clear or obvious as the aims of Bolshevik revolution in October, but one of its consequences was the awakening of the consciousness of nations and the belief that self-government could follow. The sense of freedom and the belief in the right to national self-determination took control and helped to define the revolution’s purpose. But the forceful inclusion of nations into the USSR—either in 1922 or later—means that this was the point when the spirit of 1917 died.<br>",
        "Gone now was “the right of the peoples of <span class=\"highlight-location\">Russia</span> to free self-determination.” This promise was made by the <span class=\"highlight-politics\">Bolshevik</span> government shortly after the October Revolution. Yet instead of enshrining the freedom of the former peoples of the “prison of nations,” the 1922 treaty embodied the notion that the world’s proletariat—including those who were once oppressed by the Tsar—was best served by a new nation whose purpose was to challenge global <span class=\"highlight-politics\">capitalism</span>.<br>",
        "The turbulence of the previous five years continued into the more peaceful era after the Civil War, but the <span class=\"highlight-politics\">Bolshevik Party</span> had been changed by this conflict. It was now more militarized, and force was often seen as a solution to many problems. Indeed, in the previous year, <span class=\"highlight-historicalperson\">Lenin</span> sent the military to crush the Kronstadt Rebellion and suppressed the demands of sailors who had loyally defended the Bolshevik cause in 1917. The creation of the Soviet Union, and the subsequent <span class=\"highlight-politics\">Stalinist</span> centralization in the 1930s, ended of the dreams of national self-determination for millions of people and ultimately helped to kill off the hopes of many of the revolutionaries of 1917.<br>",
