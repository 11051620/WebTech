        <p> I'm Tom, a Dutch former history student from the city of Amsterdam. Currently I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at the University of Bologna. For this website, I've chosen to explore two captivating themes: Karl Gerstner and De Stijl, two movements that, in their own unique ways, have left indelible marks on the world of creativity and webdesign.</p>
        <p>Karl Gerstner's innovative approach to design and typography has really intrigued me. His ability to seamlessly blend artistry with technology resonates deeply with my digital journey. Conversely, De Stijl, a movement rooted in the Netherlands, holds a special place in my heart as a Dutch native. Its commitment to abstraction, simplicity, and geometric forms reflects the Dutch design philosophy that has always been very visible in the place where I am from. Thank you for visiting, I hope you enjoy my take on these two innovative and beautiful design styles</p>
